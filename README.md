<h1>Dance Monster :skull:</h1>

<h3>Description :page_facing_up:</h3>

This is a pseudo-musical game in which your task is to press the arrows at the right moment.
The task is further complicated by the fact that as you gain points their speed gradually increases.
You have to remember to redirect all your attention to your sense of sight, as it is the position of the arrow that determines when you have to press the key.
